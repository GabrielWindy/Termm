# Termm

Dead and will no longer receive updates. Im not deleting for historical purposes only.

Termm is a modifiable terminal made in Python.

I made it so I can make my life easier when managing things up.

Do I recommend you to install this and use this on a daily basis? No. Absolutely not.

But if you so happen to install this, I recommend making your own commands, because its easy to do so.

I spent like, 3 hours of my life writing a tutorial on how to make custom commands, if you want to read it, feel free to go to [CUSTOM_COMMANDS.md](CUSTOM_COMMANDS.md).
