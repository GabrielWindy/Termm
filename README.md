# Termm

Termm is a modifiable terminal made in Python.

I made it so I can make my life easier when managing things up.

Do I recommend you to install this and use this on a daily basis? No. Absolutely not.

But if you so happen to install this, I recommend making your own commands, because its easy to do so.

For now, there isn't a beautiful tutorial documentation thing to teach you how to do it, but you can check the [example file](customcmds/example.py) and try to learn from that, or just look at the termm.py file and try to understand it.
